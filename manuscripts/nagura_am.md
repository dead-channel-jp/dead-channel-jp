<!--
キャラクターの問題は愛の問題であり、キャラクターをめぐる小説は愛をめぐる哲学の試みである。新井素子『……絶句』を継承し、ネット環境でアップデートする、キャラクター小説＝哲学の新たな傑作が誕生。関西弁の地の文もいいよ！
東浩紀

> A question about charaters is a question about love, and also a novel about characters is a philosophical thought experiment about love. Inheriting [Motoko Arai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoko_Arai)'s _"...Speechless"_（…絶句）, Nagura updates it in this internet environment. This is a new born masterpiece of philosophical characters' novels. Narrative parts written in Kansai dialect are also good!

ハーレムエンドはいかに正当化されるか？　セカイ系をなろう系に改装し、新本格と重ね合わせてすべての可能世界に拡張する、最強のワイドスクリーン・メタフィクション！　いい人すぎて涙が出ます。

> How "Harlem End" can be acceptable? _"Alternative Sekaikei"_ renovates Sekaikei to Naroukei, mix the New Orthodox School Detective Novels, and extends the connections between every possible worlds. This is a strongest wide-screen metafication! The narrator is a very good man to make my tears drop.
